## Conclusion
I am really happy with everything that has been achieved already. Being able to reach 727 new users (reported in Analytics), and 212 clicks from 6121 Google impressions feels great.
As for improvements, it would be nice to have a higher CTR (currently 3.5%) and to be able to get some traction on social media. I think this would naturally increase the affiliate, partner, and advertisement results. 

All in all, I think it has been a successful launch and 2023. Let's see what 2024 will bring!
